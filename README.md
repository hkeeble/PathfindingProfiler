# Pathfinding Profiler
This pathfinding profiler contains a collection of pathfinding algorithms, and includes some tools with
which to profile the performance of each algorithm. The program is written in C#, using the Microsoft XNA Game Framework.

## Included Algorithms
* Dijkstra
* A Star
* Scent Algorithm

## Features
The program can be used to visualize any included pathfinding algorithm on any given 2D map, constructed of square tiles.
It is also possible to generate your own random maps with the map generator. The program features a test configuration tool
that can be used to configure tests to be run in certain algorithms on a given map, and outputs a file containing the results
of the test. This is useful for making comparisons between the different algorithms given different maps and different test
parameters.
